- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new version of ["Name The Game"](https://www.name-the-game-net), which I did in plain PHP (17 years ago), but this time made in laravel/livewire .
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Laravel / Livewire / TailwindCSS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any ZXSpectrum related project.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding as much information about ZXSpectrum games as possible.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you wish, I may or may not answer ;)
- ðŸ“« You can also reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joselaborges), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RootShell.jb/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned to program on the ZXSpectrum 48K (BASIC) and STILL love this machine, and play games on it, even after more than 30 years.
